Intersection Observer Setup:
A new IntersectionObserver is created with a callback function that will be executed whenever observed elements intersect with a specified root element ($scrollBox in this case).
The IntersectionObserver is configured with a threshold of 0, meaning the callback will be triggered as soon as any part of the observed element becomes visible.

Callback Function:
The callback function takes two parameters: entries and observer.
For each entry in the entries array, the code checks if the observed element is intersecting with the root element ($scrollBox).
If the observed element is intersecting, it calculates the scroll position needed to make the observed element fully visible within the scrolling container.
It then animates the scroll position of $scrollBox to the calculated value over 500 milliseconds, ensuring a smooth scrolling effect.
After the scrolling animation completes, it resets the scrolling flag and restores the scrolling behavior of $scrollBox.

Observing Elements:
The code iterates over each element in $scrollGrp, which presumably contains the elements to be observed.
For each element, it registers it with the IntersectionObserver by calling observer.observe(group).

Scrolling Control:
The isScrolling flag is used to prevent overlapping scroll animations. If a scroll animation is already in progress (isScrolling is true), it temporarily disables scrolling (overflow-y: hidden) while the animation is running.
If an observed element is not intersecting and its intersection ratio is 0, it re-observes the element. This ensures that the observer continues to monitor the element even if it temporarily becomes hidden or scrolled out of view.
